If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net black_parrot_bd_1_i/top_0/inst/top_zynq_inst/blackparrot/axil2io/FSM_sequential_state_n_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin black_parrot_bd_1_i/top_0/inst/top_zynq_inst/blackparrot/axil2io/FSM_sequential_state_n_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell black_parrot_bd_1_i/top_0/inst/top_zynq_inst/blackparrot/axil2io/FSM_sequential_state_n_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
