Gated clock check  
Net black_parrot_bd_1_i/top_0/inst/top_zynq_inst/blackparrot/axil2io/FSM_sequential_state_n_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin black_parrot_bd_1_i/top_0/inst/top_zynq_inst/blackparrot/axil2io/FSM_sequential_state_n_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell black_parrot_bd_1_i/top_0/inst/top_zynq_inst/blackparrot/axil2io/FSM_sequential_state_n_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
